title: AWS security integration
metaDescription: 'Send your security data from AWS Security Hub, GuardDuty, and inspector directly to New Relic.'
---
You can import AWS Security Hub, GuardDuty, and Inspector findings into New Relic to achieve a single, unified view of vulnerabilities. The process uses EventBridge to post findings from AWS Security reporting services via an AWS API Destination.

After completion of these steps, you will see new vulnerabilities detected by AWS Security tools in your New Relic account in real time, and you'll be able to build out analytics dashboards and enable alerts on newly detected issues.

## Prerequisites

To send AWS security data to New Relic:
- [Enable AWS Security Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-settingup.html) on your AWS account. 
- Obtain a New Relic [license key](/docs/accounts-partnerships/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key) for the account you want to report data to.

Optional: 
- [Enable AWS GuardDuty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_settingup.html).
- [Enable AWS Inspector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/getting_started_tutorial.html).

## 1. Create API destination

1. In your AWS UI navigate to **EventBridge > Integrations > API destinations > Create API destination**.
2. Fill in the prompts.
3. Construct your endpoint using the pattern below, and enter it into API destination endpoint:

```
https://security-ingest-processor.service.newrelic.com/v1/security/webhooks/awssecurityhub?Api-Key=<var>NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY</var>
```

Select **POST** as the HTTP method.
Select **Create a new connection**.

## 2. Create a new connection
1. Fill in the fields in the new prompt.
2. For **Destination** select **Other**.
3. For **Authorization type** select **API Key**.
4. For **API Key Name** type `Api-Key` and paste your New Relic License Key[license key](/docs/accounts-partnerships/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key) as the value.
